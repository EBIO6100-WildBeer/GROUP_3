# 1. CLEAN UP TAXONOMY
# Right now, the fungal and bacteria taxonomy is not ordered the same. For example, the fungal taxonomic information
# starts at Eukaryota, whereas the bacterial starts at bacteria (not prokaryote). And there is a whole lot of 
# extra taxonomic information between "eukaryote" and "fungi" in the fungal ones.

## i. first, take a look at the raw data
colnames(beerComm)
head(beerComm)
step1 <- beerComm[,c(5,6)] #get only dbhit and taxonomy columns; keep all rows
colnames(step1)

## ii. Remove extra taxonomic information between Eukaryote and Fungi, as well as subkingdom and subdivisions
# btw, here is a great "cheat sheet" for using regular expressions in R: https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf
step2 <- step1[,2] %>%  
  stringr::str_replace("^.*Nucletmycea;", "") %>% # "^" is start of string, "." is every character, and "*" is any length.
  # So, this line means replace any and everything between the start of the line and "Nucletmycea" with nothing. 
  stringr::str_replace("Dikarya;", "") %>% #replace "Dikarya" with "" (i.e. replace it with nothing!)
  stringr::str_replace("Saccharomycotina;", "") %>% 
  stringr::str_replace("Agaricomycotina;", "")
colnames(step2)
cleaned1 <- cbind(step1[,1], step2) #combine the cleaned taxonomy column with dbhit from step 1 
colnames(cleaned1) <- colnames(step1) #make dbHit and taxonomy the column names again
# View(cleaned1)

## iii. Divide out taxonomy into different columns by level
beerTax <- tidyr::separate(as.data.frame(cleaned1), col = taxonomy, into= c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", 
                                                                            "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species"),
                           sep = ";")
# View(beerTax) 
colnames(beerComm)
unique(beerTax$dbHit == beerComm$dbHit) # since the order and the names of the dbHits are the same for beerTax and beerCommLess, 
# we can just do a simple cbind to merge them
beerCommLess <- beerComm[,c(1:4,7:10)] #no need to keep dbhit or Taxonomy columns (since we fixed taxonomy)
dim(beerCommLess)
beerCommCleaned <- cbind(beerCommLess, beerTax)
# View(beerCommCleaned)

# 2. MAKE DATA "WIDER" (AS REQUIRED BY PHYLOSEQ)
commCompTable <- beerCommCleaned %>% #beerCommCleaned is on this line because it is the object we are manipulating
  select(read_cov, sample:Species) %>% #makes it so that we are manipulating the columns read_cov 
  # and all of the columns from sample to Species (i.e. sample, dbHit, and all the taxonomy info)
  filter(!(sample %in% c('NTC', 'ExtB1', 'CommStd'))) %>%  #remove these samples. Important because they are not in our metadata,
  # and to make a phyloseq object, samples must be the same across metadata and ASV table
  pivot_wider(names_from=sample, values_from=read_cov) %>% #make the samples new columns and the values in these new columns 
  # come from read_cov
  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0)) #replace NAs with zeros
# View(commCompTable)

# 3. MAKE TAXONOMY TABLE FOR PHYLOSEQ
# ASV/OTU names (i.e. dbHit for us!) should be the rownames and then their should be a distinct column for each taxonomic level
taxTab <- commCompTable %>% 
  column_to_rownames("dbHit") %>% #make it so that dbHit is now the row names of this dataframe
  select(Kingdom:Species) #take only the columns corresponding to the taxonomy info from commCompTable
# View(taxTab) #looks good!

# 4. MAKE ASV/OTU TABLE FOR PHYLOSEQ
# Here, phyloseq wants each taxon/ASV/OTU (here our dbHit name) as the rowname, with the columns as the separate
# samples. The values in these columns are simply the number of counts of each ASV/OTU/taxon in each sample.
# This is now the rest of the info in "commCompTable" made above
ASVtab <- commCompTable %>% 
  column_to_rownames("dbHit") %>% #make it so that dbHit is now the row names of this dataframe
  select("HI4-3":"HI4-1")  #R is being tripped up by the fact that samples have "-3" and "-1" in their names, so I
# added quotation marks. This is usually not necessary when using the select function.
# View(ASVtab) #Yay! Looks as expected!

# 5. FORMAT METADATA FILE FOR PHYLOSEQ
# View(beerMeta)
metaDat <- beerMeta %>% column_to_rownames("Sample.ID") #make the rownames the sample IDs. These now match up with 
# ASVtab
# View(metaDat)

# 6. PUT TAXONOMY, ASV TABLE, AND METADATA TOGETHER TO MAKE PHYLOSEQ OBJECT
# Need to use built-in phyloseq functions (tax_table, otu_table, and sample_data) to build each component of the phyloseq object
TAX <- tax_table(as.matrix(taxTab))
OTU <- otu_table(ASVtab, taxa_are_rows=T) 
META <- sample_data(metaDat)
beerPhyloseq <- phyloseq(TAX, OTU, META)

# This is the original phyloseq object! To see any of the component parts, re-use the functions above
beerPhyloseq 
sample_data(beerPhyloseq) #wahoo! Metadata!
tax_table(beerPhyloseq) 
otu_table(beerPhyloseq)

# HYPOTHESIS TESTING
########################################

# 1. QUESTION 1: Is hopped different than unhopped?
# Method 1: PERMANOVA-- this is a non-parametric method that tests the null hypothesis that the centroids and
# and dispersions of the groups as defined by measure space are equivalent for all groups. If the null is 
# rejected, then it means that EITHER the centroid or the spread of the objects is different between the groups.
# The PERMANOVA is done on the underlying distance matrix (i.e. NOT on the output of the ordination technique)
# Thus, Thus, if H0 were true, any observed differences among the centroids in a given set of data will be similar
# in size to what would be obtained under random allocation of individual sample units to the groups (i.e., under permuration)

# Look within whole dataset
# i. PERMANOVA: 
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
adonis2(formula = beerBCdist ~ Hops, data= as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerPS_cleaned))))
# This shows that hopped samples are different than unhopped samples (p < 0.001)

# ii. Mantel test. Although Mantel tests are usually 

# QUESTION 1.1: We know that hopped samples are significantly different than unhopped samples. Do hopped and unhopped 
# samples differ in how similar the samples within each group are to one another?
# Calculate multivariate dispersions
mod_disp1 <- betadisper(beerBCdist, group= factor(as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerPS_cleaned)))$Hops), 
                        type = "centroid")
# test it
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
anova(mod_disp1, permutations = 9999)
# This shows that there the differences among samples are the same hopped and unhopped, which is surprising

# Plot it!
plot(mod_disp1)
# 2. QUESTION 2: Is indoors different from outdoors?
# Since we know that hopped samples are different than unhopped samples, we will test this on hopped and unhopped samples
# separately.

#. i. PERMANOVA ON HOPPED:
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
adonis2(formula = hoppedBCdist ~ Location, data= as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerHopped_ps))))
# Hopped samples are not different indoors or outdoors, but it's somewhat close to significant

# ii. Is a difference in variation among hopped samples indoors or outdoors?
mod_disp2 <- betadisper(hoppedBCdist, group= factor(as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerHopped_ps)))$Location), 
                        type = "centroid")
# test it
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
anova(mod_disp2, permutations = 9999) #no, no difference (P = 0.93323)

#. iii. PERMANOVA ON UNHOPPED:
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
adonis2(formula = unhoppedBCdist ~ Location, data= as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerUnhopped_ps))))
# Unhopped samples are also not significantly different based on being indoors or outdoors

# iv. Is a difference in variation among unhopped samples indoors or outdoors?
mod_disp3 <- betadisper(unhoppedBCdist, group= factor(as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerUnhopped_ps)))$Location), 
                        type = "centroid")
# test it
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
anova(mod_disp3, permutations = 9999) #YES!!! P = 0.0217
# So this means that within unhopped samples, either indoor or outdoor samples are more different from each other
# Looking at the average distances to centroid shows that there is 0.28 average distance to centroid for indoor 
# samples and 0.1683 for outdoor. So, the indoor samples are actually a little more varied.

# QUESTION 3: Timepoints: Is week 1 different from week 3? Can break down even further to say “is there an indoor outdoor difference
# at week 1 versus is there an indoor/outdoor difference during week 3? Which taxa are relatively more abundant in week 1 versus week 3?

# i. This asks, within hopped samples, is there a difference between week 1 and week 3 and does being inside or outside matter
# for this relationship?
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
adonis2(formula = hoppedBCdist ~ timepoint + Location*timepoint, data= as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerHopped_ps))))
# This tells us that that within hopped samples, there is a difference between week 1 and week 3 and between indoor and outdoor
# samples. However, there is no significant interaction effect between location and timepoint 

# ii. This asks, within unhopped samples, is there a difference between week 1 and week 3 and does being inside or outside matter
# for this relationship?
# set seed!!
set.seed(93)
adonis2(formula = unhoppedBCdist ~ timepoint + Location*timepoint, data= as.data.frame(as.matrix(sample_data(beerUnhopped_ps))))
# This shows that within unhopped samples, week 1 is different than week 3, and that it this relationship holds for both
# indoor and outdoor samples. Location does not seem to matter

# QUESTION 4: What taxa are driving the differences?
# For this, I perform an indicator species analysis, using a function (indSpecTable2) that I wrote previously,
# found here: https://github.com/clairecwinfrey/PhanBioMS_scripts/blob/master/R_scripts/analysis/IndicSpeciesAnalysisFInalJan2022.R
